```lrc
[00:25.53] I was given a heart before I was given a mind
[00:30.55] A thirst for pleasure and war, a hunger we keep inside
[00:35.14] We fell from sky with grace, and life gave us a sweeter taste
[00:39.51] You can drink, you can feast
[00:43.96] There's beauty in your beast
[00:57.96] 
[00:47.97] The flesh in the fruit and the blood in the wine
[01:11.97] 
[00:50.81] Come on, and feel alive, lover
[00:53.38] Come on, and feel the love like a sinner
[00:56.05] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say
[01:01.41] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[01:04.03] Can you break the chains, off her?
[01:06.61] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
[01:28.61] 
[01:13.47] I was given a name before I was given blood
[01:18.79] Like you were given your faith, before there was made a God
[01:23.29] Young rivers in your hands and glass burning in promised lands
[01:27.79] You can drink, you can feast
[01:31.92] There's beauty in your beast
[01:45.92] 
[01:35.83] The flesh in the fruit and the blood in the wine
[01:59.83] 
[01:38.68] Come on, and feel alive, lover
[01:41.45] Come on, and feel the love like a sinner
[01:44.04] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say
[01:49.50] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[01:52.19] Can you break the chains, off her?
[01:54.52] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
[02:16.52] 
[02:13.48] Come on, and feel alive
[02:16.15] Come on, feel the love
[02:18.62] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say (louder)
[02:24.31] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[02:26.82] Can you break the chains, off her?
[02:29.39] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
[02:51.39] 
[02:56.07] Come on, and feel alive, lover
[02:58.65] Come on and feel the love, like a sinner
[03:01.44] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say
[03:06.61] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[03:09.55] Can you break the chains, off her?
[03:11.90] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
