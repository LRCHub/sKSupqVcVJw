I left behind a life to seek the truth behind a parish
Built upon its own demise
The line is so very thin
Between devil and divine
Hypocrites prey on the weak
To give false hope in their fiction
For their own financial gain
"Heathens, buy your way into heaven"

Pretender, the disconnect speaks for you
Are we worthy of your presence, so pure and precious
Its nothing more than a mask
To hide the silver tongue you speak with
Charlatan, tend to your flock
Fill their graves when they're drained of their worth
Cast your judgement, but you of all people should know
Those in glass houses should not thrown stones

Tantalize, feed them lies, seducer
Justify, vindicate your sanctified slaughter

You defile this place
Face to face with your apathy
You're a disgrace to your deity
No, it's not enough to move mountains with your words, is it?
Always searching for more souls to ruin
Take a page out of your own book
Consume the flesh and drink the poison blood in the wine

I fucking dare you, convince me you're not a fraud
Practice what you preach

Shut your fucking mouth
All you are is a false prophet
We see through all your lies
You're not safe when you walk among the graves you fill

Your hivemind is powerless to resist
Blind devotion is your bliss
Fuck that
Devils burn in the same place as angels
You're no god
