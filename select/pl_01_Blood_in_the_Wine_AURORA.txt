I was given a heart
Before I was given a mind
A thirst for pleasure and war
A hunger we keep inside
We fell from sky with grace
And life gave us a sweeter taste
You can drink
You can feast
There's beauty in your beast
The flesh in the fruit
And the blood in the wine
Come and feel alive, lover
Come and feel the love
like a sinner
Shout it louder
Shout it for the ones
who could never say
"I won't feel ashamed, Mother"
"Can you break the chains of
her?"
Shout it louder
Not a sinner, she's a lover
I was given a name
Before I was given blood
Like you were given your faith
Before there was made a God
Young rivers in your hands
And grass burning
in promised lands
You can drink
You can feast
There's beauty in your beast
The flesh in the fruit
And the blood in the wine
Come and feel alive, lover
Come and feel the love
like a sinner
Shout it louder
Shout it for the ones
who could never say
"I won't feel ashamed, Mother"
"Can you break the chains of
her?"
Shout it louder
Not a sinner, she's a lover
Come and feel alive
Come and feel the love
Shout it louder
Shout it for the ones
who could never say
"I won't feel ashamed, Mother"
"Can you break the chains of
her?"
Shout it louder
Not a sinner, she's a lover
Come and feel alive, lover
Come and feel the love
like a sinner
Shout it louder
Shout it for the ones
who could never say
"I won't feel ashamed, Mother"
"Can you break the chains of
her?"
Shout it louder
Not a sinner, she's a lover
