[00:25.53] I was given a heart before I was given a mind
[00:30.58] A thirst for pleasure and war, a hunger we keep inside
[00:35.15] We fell from sky with grace, and life gave us a sweeter taste
[00:39.54] You can drink, you can feast
[00:43.97] There's beauty in your beast
[00:57.97] 
[00:47.97] The flesh in the fruit and the blood in the wine
[01:11.97] 
[00:50.85] Come on, and feel alive, lover
[00:53.36] Come on, and feel the love like a sinner
[00:56.06] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say
[01:01.45] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[01:04.06] Can you break the chains, off her?
[01:06.62] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
[01:28.62] 
[01:13.49] I was given a name before I was given blood
[01:18.73] Like you were given your faith, before there was made a God
[01:23.25] Young rivers in your hands and glass burning in promised lands
[01:27.74] You can drink, you can feast
[01:31.98] There's beauty in your beast
[01:45.98] 
[01:35.83] The flesh in the fruit and the blood in the wine
[01:59.83] 
[01:38.62] Come on, and feel alive, lover
[01:41.44] Come on, and feel the love like a sinner
[01:44.00] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say
[01:49.58] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[01:52.17] Can you break the chains, off her?
[01:54.52] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
[02:16.52] 
[02:13.43] Come on, and feel alive
[02:16.12] Come on, feel the love
[02:18.61] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say (louder)
[02:24.39] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[02:26.81] Can you break the chains, off her?
[02:29.33] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
[02:51.33] 
[02:56.07] Come on, and feel alive, lover
[02:58.65] Come on and feel the love, like a sinner
[03:01.42] Shout it louder, shout it for the ones who could never say
[03:06.62] I won't feel ashamed, mother
[03:09.58] Can you break the chains, off her?
[03:11.99] Shout it louder, not a sinner, she's a lover
